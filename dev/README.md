## shellcheck

Runs [Shellcheck](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck) on all
version-controlled shell programs, to help identify and avoid some shell
pitfalls.  This can be run by hand to check your work locally, but it will also
be run automatically on every push as part of our CI.

## refresh-database

As a quick start, you can refresh your local dev database with:

    ./dev/refresh-database

Refreshing the testing database is:

    PGHOST=testing.db.seattleflu.org PGDATABASE=testing PGUSER=postgres ./dev/refresh-database

If you provide a directory as the first argument, the database dump will be
preserved and re-used between runs.  This lets you save a bunch of time and use
the same dump for a week or two for local dev.

See `./dev/refresh-database --help` for more information.

If you get an error similar to:
`pg_restore: [archiver] unsupported version (1.14) in file header`
try a workaround described on
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59455783/pg-restore-archiver-unsupported-version-1-14-in-file-header
Run pg_restore with the `--host=localhost` option. For example:
`pg_restore --dbname "seattleflu" production.pgdb --host=localhost --user=postgres`

### Setting up a database for the first time

If you are setting up a new local dev database, make a postgres user and database named after
your OS username and assign the user superuser privileges, before running refresh-database

### Common Error
If you are running this script on a Mac, you may run into this error:
```
./dev/refresh-database: line 107: syntax error near unexpected token `&'
```
This is due to the default version of bash on macOS being extremely outdated.
Install the latest version of bash via Homebrew to run this script.
