-- ***** Here is SQL to populate the operations.test_quota table for the test quota,
-- ***** used for the UW Reopening's test offering job.
-- ***** One row per hour will get inserted. The insert command will also get raised so
-- ***** you can see it.

-- ***** Set correct values for these fields at the top:
-- ***** daily_quota: The total quota for the day. This will get divided between the hours. Remainders get dropped.
-- ***** start_date: The starting date to insert for.
-- ***** num_days: The number of days to insert for, including the starting date.
-- ***** start_hour: The starting hour (lower boundary of the timerange) to insert for. 8 = 08:00 (8 AM)
-- ***** end_hour: The ending hour (upper boundary of the timerange) to insert for. 20 = 20:00 (8 PM)
-- ***** hour_interval: The hour intervals for quotas, with 1 = every hour and 2 = every other hour.
