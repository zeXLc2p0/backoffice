# XXX TODO: Explicitly configure the location the geocoding cache when that is
# supported by our code.  Currently it ends up as cache.pickle in the working
# directory, which is /home/ubuntu in this case.  Possibly use separate cache
# files for each REDCap project.
#
# XXX TODO: Remove locking of the cache file (to prevent corruption/race
# conditions) once locking is done by ID3C directly.
#
# Transform REDCap DETs to FHIR documents every 10 minutes, interleaving kiosk
# and swab-n-send on the 5s (since they share a cache file).  Ingest FHIR
# documents every 5 minutes, scheduled 3 minutes after each DET run.
